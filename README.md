# Salon App
This application will be built for 'The Blend', which is a hybrid barbershop and salon, offering services such as hair-cutting, hair colouring and styling, waxing, nail treatments, massage, as well as facial and skin-care treatments.


The main goal for the app is to allow customers to book an appointment at the salon in advance, thus making it easier to manage clients and workflow at the salon. 

The app requires a user to first create an account and then login. Then the user will be prompted to select a service, choose the preferred barber/stylist, and also reserve a time slot using their smartphones. Afterwards, a reservation confirm message which contains user data will be sent to the selected stylist.

## Languages and Tools
The main languages and frameworks that will be used to develop the core of the project will be Dart and Flutter.
